Well, they're here! Lovingly inspired by [bluss/indexing],
but updated for the best practices of the 2018 edition.

The README will get an overhaul once the version 0.2 is finished baking;
in the mean time, [bluss_indexing.md](bluss_indexing.md) provides a
mapping between the prior API surface and that exposed by windex.
